<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) Management Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CSF Shunts</li><li>CSF Drainage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) management market is primarily divided into two main types: CSF shunts and CSF drainage systems. CSF shunts are implanted devices designed to redirect excess cerebrospinal fluid from the brain's ventricles to other body areas, alleviating conditions like hydrocephalus. On the other hand, CSF drainage systems are used for temporary drainage of CSF to manage pressure and prevent complications related to various neurological disorders. Both play crucial roles in maintaining cerebrospinal fluid balance and ensuring optimal brain function.</p></p>
