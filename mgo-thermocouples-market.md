<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MGO Thermocouples Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Grounded Type</li><li>Ungrounded Type</li><li>Exposed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>MGO thermocouples, primarily used for high-temperature applications, come in three main types: grounded, ungrounded, and exposed. Grounded types feature a junction that is directly connected to the sheath, providing rapid response but compromising electrical isolation. Ungrounded types have a sensor isolated from the sheath, ensuring better electrical performance but a slower response time. Exposed types have the sensing element directly exposed to the environment, allowing for rapid temperature measurement but may be less durable in harsh conditions.</p></p>
