<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Analgesic Infusion Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Patient-Controlled Analgesia Pump (PCA Pump)</li><li>Intrathecal Pump</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Analgesic infusion pumps are medical devices that deliver pain relief medication directly to patients. The patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump allows patients to self-administer pre-set doses of analgesics, such as opioids, empowering them to manage their pain effectively. In contrast, intrathecal pumps deliver medication directly into the spinal fluid, providing targeted pain relief for chronic pain conditions. Both pump types enhance pain management, improving patient comfort and reducing the reliance on oral medications or frequent injections.</p></p>
